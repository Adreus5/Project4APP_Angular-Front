Website pages start to take shape in the fourth phase of the atomic approach. Templates are groups of organisms
combined to form the structure of a page.

If we look at a homepage, the header and footer organisms we started with are found in the homepage template.
These organisms join others to make up the homepage template, as shown in the image above.

Templates are effective because they ensure components of a visual identity system are crafted to look and function
together. Atomic design templates can be viewed as a skeleton of a page.
