After the first four phases, designers have all the elements they need to build out pages for the UI of a website.

If the previous four steps were done correctly, then the final step gives designers the freedom to drop in images,
text, and all that good stuff to give them an idea of what the UI will look like.

The final appearance of the pages dictates whether the site is ready to launch, or whether the developer needs to
loop back and make changes to earlier design elements.
